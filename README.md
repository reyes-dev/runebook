# Facebook clone
This repo is for the [final Rails project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-rails-final-project) of The Odin Project's curriculum. It is a Facebook-like website that emulates the core features of a social media platform -- users, profiles, "friending", posts, news feeds, and "liking". It implements sign-in with the real Facebook using OmniAuth and Devise. User data and posts are populated with the "Faker" gem.
