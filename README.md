## What is Runebook?
Runebook is my take on building a fullstack social media web application. It is a Ruby on Rails monolith taking full advantage of the frameworks capabilities to deliver on all desired features. The intended purpose of Runebook is to gain experience building a Rails app with a full suite of features that you might find on a social media website like Facebook or Instagram, where users can share text or images, add friends and persist their data in a database.
